# emrecdem-framework
In this repository we develop the a framework for handling the multi-model data.

Goals and sub-goals are included in the issue-tracker of this repository.

Our overall goal is to build a system that can do the following:
- Load and store time series derived from multi-model data (video, audio, text).
- Make the data searchable.
- Provide an interface for analytics and visualisation.
